# Nuclear Energy Plant Radiation Plugin

This project was developed on the course of the Geographic Information System (GIS) of the master's degree program in data science at the University of Salerno. The goal of this project was develop a python plugin for the software Quantum GIS (QGIS) in order to visualize on the open street map all nuclear energy plant in the world. This plugin use the mqtt protocol for receive of radiation data from sensors in order to dinamically visualize it on the map. In order to clarify the visualization of the radiation data, a heat map was created and used.


## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See 
deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.


### Prerequisites
First of all, you will need a machine running QGIS (it is available for Windows, Linux, MacOS. Android, FreeBSD ).
